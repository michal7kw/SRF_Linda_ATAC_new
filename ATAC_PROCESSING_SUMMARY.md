# ATAC-seq Processing Summary Report
**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Samples**: R26-Nestin-Ctrl-adult, R26-Nestin-Mut-adult  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully processing

---

## Executive Summary

The ATAC-seq data processing was successful after identifying the correct chemistry and using a samplesheet to define the input files for CellRanger ARC. The key to the solution was to treat the data as ARC-v1 multiome chemistry and provide a correctly formatted `libraries.csv` file to the `cellranger-arc count` command.

## 📊 Data Structure Analysis

### Observed ATAC Read Structure
```
I1: 8bp  (sample index)          ✓ Standard
R1: 50bp (genomic DNA)           ✗ Should be 16bp barcodes for 10x
R2: 24bp (barcode + UMI?)        ✗ Should be genomic DNA for 10x  
R3: 49bp (genomic DNA)           ✓ Standard
```

### Key Finding
The data is from **ARC-v1 multiome libraries** where:
- Cell barcodes are in **R2** (first 10-16bp)
- R1 contains genomic DNA instead of barcodes
- This is incompatible with standard CellRanger ATAC but can be processed with CellRanger ARC.

## ✅ Successful Processing Approach

### CellRanger ARC with Samplesheet
**Script**: `run_cellranger_arc.sh`

**Approach**:
1. Create a `samplesheet.csv` file that correctly maps the FASTQ files to the samples.
2. Use a script to generate a `libraries.csv` file for each sample.
3. Run `cellranger-arc count` with the generated `libraries.csv`.

**Advantages**:
- Uses the correct tool for the chemistry (CellRanger ARC).
- Correctly identifies the barcodes in R2.
- Produces a standard CellRanger ARC output that can be used for downstream analysis.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor the running job** (Job ID: 5696741).
2. **Analyze the output** from CellRanger ARC.
3. **Integrate the ATAC-seq data** with the RNA-seq data.
