Bulk ATAC-seq Analysis Summary
==============================
Date: Mon Aug 25 08:27:49 PM CEST 2025

This report summarizes the results of the bulk ATAC-seq processing for the Nestin and Emx1 samples.
The analysis was performed using the scripts:
- run_bulk_atac_nestin.sh
- run_bulk_atac_emx1.sh

The expected outcomes are defined in:
- ATAC_data/DOCs/BULK_ATAC_SETUP_AND_USAGE.md

Conclusion
---
The bulk ATAC-seq analysis appears to be largely successful.
  - All samples show excellent alignment rates (100%).
  - The number of broad peaks is high, which may be acceptable but is outside the expected 20k-100k range.
  - Narrow peak counts are missing from the reports, which should be investigated.

The results are suitable for downstream analysis, but the peak counts should be reviewed.
