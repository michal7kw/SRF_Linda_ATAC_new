# ATAC-seq Data Processing - Current Status Analysis

**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Samples**: R26-Nestin-Ctrl-adult, R26-Nestin-Mut-adult  
**Status**: ‚ùå **UNRESOLVED - Multiple Fundamental Issues**

---

## Executive Summary

The ATAC-seq data processing has **NOT been successfully resolved** despite multiple attempts with different approaches. The legacy documentation incorrectly claimed success, but extensive testing reveals fundamental incompatibilities that prevent standard single-cell ATAC-seq processing.

## üö® Critical Problems Identified

### 1. **Non-Standard Data Structure**
- **Issue**: Data uses ARC-v1 multiome chemistry but with non-standard read structure
- **Evidence**: 
  - R1 contains 50bp genomic DNA (should contain 16bp cell barcodes)
  - R2 contains 24bp barcodes/UMI (should contain genomic DNA)
  - R3 contains 49bp genomic DNA (standard)

### 2. **Tool Incompatibility**
- **CellRanger ATAC**: Fails with only 0.5% valid barcodes (needs >10%)
- **CellRanger ARC**: Requires both ATAC and RNA libraries from same cells
- **Custom approaches**: RNA-ATAC barcode matching shows 0.00-0.5% overlap

### 3. **Separate Sequencing Runs**
- **Critical Finding**: RNA and ATAC were sequenced in **separate runs**
- **Impact**: No shared cell barcodes between datasets
- **Evidence**: Custom analysis shows virtually no barcode overlap between RNA and ATAC

## üìä Failed Approaches Summary

| Approach | Tool | Result | Barcode Match Rate |
|----------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Standard ATAC | CellRanger ATAC | ‚ùå Failed | 2.4% |
| ARC Chemistry | CellRanger ATAC (ARC-v1) | ‚ùå Failed | 0.5% |
| Multiome Processing | CellRanger ARC | ‚ùå Failed | N/A (missing RNA) |
| Swapped Reads | CellRanger ATAC (R1‚ÜîR2) | ‚ùå Failed | 0.5% |
| Mock RNA Libraries | CellRanger ARC + Mock | ‚ùå Failed | N/A (missing RNA) |
| RNA Barcode Filtering | Custom Python Script | ‚ùå Failed | 0.00% (Ctrl), 0.00% (Mut) |

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: **Sequencing Protocol Mismatch**
The fundamental problem is that this data was **NOT generated using standard 10x Genomics protocols**:

1. **Chemistry**: Uses ARC-v1 multiome structure but ATAC was sequenced separately
2. **Barcoding**: Cell barcodes are in R2 (position 7, length 16) instead of R1
3. **Cell Isolation**: RNA and ATAC appear to be from different cell populations
4. **Read Structure**: Non-standard read organization incompatible with 10x tools

### Secondary Issues:
- **Documentation**: Previous reports incorrectly claimed success
- **Tool Limitations**: Standard 10x tools cannot handle this data structure
- **Missing Information**: Actual sequencing protocol and chemistry details unknown

## üìã Missing Critical Information

### 1. **Sequencing Protocol Details**
- [ ] Actual library preparation protocol used
- [ ] Exact chemistry version and modifications
- [ ] Barcode design and location specification
- [ ] Quality control metrics from sequencing facility

### 2. **Sample Preparation Information**
- [ ] Were RNA and ATAC from same cell preparation?
- [ ] What was the temporal relationship between RNA and ATAC sequencing?
- [ ] What cell isolation and nuclei preparation methods were used?
- [ ] Were there any custom modifications to standard 10x protocols?

### 3. **Technical Specifications**
- [ ] Expected barcode structure and location
- [ ] UMI design and usage
- [ ] Adapter sequences and trimming requirements
- [ ] Index and sample multiplexing strategy

## üéØ Potential Resolution Pathways

### Option 1: **Bulk ATAC-seq Processing**
**Rationale**: Treat data as bulk rather than single-cell
- **Approach**: Concatenate all reads, align with BWA, call peaks with MACS2
- **Pros**: Bypasses barcode issues, standard workflow
- **Cons**: Loses single-cell resolution

### Option 2: **Protocol-Agnostic Tools**
**Rationale**: Use tools that don't require 10x compatibility
- **Tools**: SnapATAC2, ArchR with custom input, custom pipelines
- **Pros**: May handle non-standard formats
- **Cons**: Requires significant method development

### Option 3: **Contact Sequencing Facility**
**Rationale**: Clarify actual protocol and get proper processing instructions
- **Action**: Request detailed protocol documentation
- **Ask for**: Barcode whitelist, expected read structure, processing recommendations
- **Timeline**: Could resolve fundamental questions quickly

### Option 4: **Custom Barcode Extraction**
**Rationale**: Develop custom tools for this specific data structure
- **Approach**: Write tools to extract barcodes from R2 position 7
- **Requirements**: Significant bioinformatics development
- **Uncertainty**: May still fail if cell populations are different

## üîß Current Working Scripts

### Functional but Unsuccessful Scripts:
1. **[`run_atac_with_rna_barcodes.sh`](run_atac_with_rna_barcodes.sh)** - RNA barcode filtering approach
2. **[`process_atac_custom_barcodes.py`](process_atac_custom_barcodes.py)** - Custom barcode analysis tool
3. **[`run_cellranger_atac_corrected.sh`](run_cellranger_atac_corrected.sh)** - Read-swapping approach

### Analysis Results:
- All approaches confirm minimal barcode overlap
- Custom analysis successfully identifies barcodes at R2 position 7
- No viable path to single-cell processing with current understanding

## üìû Immediate Action Items

1. **High Priority**: Contact sequencing facility with specific questions about protocol
2. **Medium Priority**: Evaluate bulk processing as interim solution  
3. **Low Priority**: Investigate protocol-agnostic tools for future attempts

Subject: Clarification Needed - ATAC-seq Protocol for Nestin Samples

We are having difficulty processing ATAC-seq data for samples R26-Nestin-Ctrl-adult 
and R26-Nestin-Mut-adult due to non-standard read structure.

Observations:
- R1 contains 50bp genomic DNA (expected: 16bp cell barcodes)
- R2 contains 24bp sequences with barcodes at position 7
- Standard 10x tools fail with <1% valid barcodes

Questions:
1. What exact protocol was used for ATAC library preparation?
2. Are cell barcodes located in R2 instead of R1?
3. Were RNA and ATAC from the same cell preparation?
4. Do you have processing recommendations for this data structure?
5. Can you provide the correct barcode whitelist?

**‚ö†Ô∏è CONCLUSION: Single-cell ATAC-seq processing is currently not feasible with available information and standard tools. Protocol clarification from sequencing facility is essential.**
